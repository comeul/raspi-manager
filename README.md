# Raspi Web Manager

This is a weird solution, that was a quick fix, to be able to remotely shutdown and reboot a Raspberry Pi used as a dashboard in our studio.

This is intended to be used **within a local network**. Our own usage is behind a firewall and the raspberry pi is _not_ exposed to the internet, therefore there is no extra layer of security consideration to have it protected from malicious usage. Use at your own risk.
